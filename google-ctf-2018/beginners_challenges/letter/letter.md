**Challenge: Letter**

Level 1 of the challenge. Download the attachment and extract the zip file. You will get a challenge.pdf file.
Open the .pdf file AND ALWAYS use some kind of sandbox for opening files even if you are sure they are "fine". Just use it!

You will see a form with blacked out (redacted) username and password.

There is always the possibility it is really redacted but in this case it is just a cover. Ctrl+A to select the whole documet and Ctrl+P into Notepad++ or
any editor of your choice and you will see the flag.
