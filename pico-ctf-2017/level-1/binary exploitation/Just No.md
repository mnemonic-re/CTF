**Writeup**

Go to the problem directory and do a file lookup. There are 4: auth  flag  justno  justno.c

justno.c looks interesting, lets cat it.

Look at this: 
> FILE* authf = fopen("../../problems/ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb/auth","r");

So what can we see... So, opening the auth file and determining if the the auth file does 
not have the word "no". If that’s true then we get the flag. So, how to trick it...

Lets try this. Type cd ~ so we can make some changes...<br/>
> mkdir temporary<br/>
> cd temporary<br/>
> mkdir temp<br/>
> cd temp<br/>
> mkdir problems<br/>
> cd problems<br/>
> mkdir ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb<br/>
> cd ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb<br/>

Ok, this should be fine for the auth trick. If we can trick it into thinking it is authed... Lets try simple cat < entry
> cat < auth<br/>
> Yes<br/>
> (Ctrl+C to exit prompt)<br/>

Now, lets see if we can run the old bugger.
> cd problems\ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb\justno<br/>
> -bash: problems\ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb\justno: No such file or directory<br/>

Interesting... Now all it remains to see if Auth is tricked by running the spoofing:

> Oh. Well the auth file doesn't say no anymore so... Here's the flag: e4cec8fdf76a931b03ad7ef026103d43<br/>

Yes!

flag: e4cec8fdf76a931b03ad7ef026103d43
