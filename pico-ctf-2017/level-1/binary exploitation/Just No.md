**Writeup**

Go to the problem directory and do a file lookup. There are 4: auth  flag  justno  justno.c

justno.c looks interesting, lets cat it.

Look at this: 
FILE* authf = fopen("../../problems/ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb/auth","r");

So what can we see... So, opening the auth file and determining if the the auth file does 
not have the word "no". If thatâ€™s true then we get the flag. So, how to trick it...

Lets try this. Type cd ~ so we can make some changes...
mkdir temporary
cd temporary
mkdir temp
cd temp
mkdir problems
cd problems
mkdir ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb
cd ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb

Ok, this should be fine for the auth trick. If we can trick it into thinking it is authed... Lets try simple cat < entry
cat < auth
Yes
(Ctrl+C to exit prompt)

Now, lets see if we can run the old bugger.
cd problems\ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb\justno
-bash: problems\ec9da1496f80c8248197ba564097cebb\justno: No such file or directory

Interesting... Now all it remains to see if Auth is tricked by running the spoofing:

> Oh. Well the auth file doesn't say no anymore so... Here's the flag: e4cec8fdf76a931b03ad7ef026103d43

Yes!

flag: e4cec8fdf76a931b03ad7ef026103d43
