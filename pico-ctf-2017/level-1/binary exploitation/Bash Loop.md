**Writeup**

First Binary Exploitation! Yay!

I was thinking and trying stuff here but then I remembered a silly thing I should have tried from a beginning. This program takes a
parameter no? Well in programs, main usually looks something like this: void main(int argc, char **argv);

Now, argv is interesting! That argv[1] holds the value and we can brute force it. Here is a small script to do it from the WebShell:

for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop $i | grep flag; done

> Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: bcb04466bee8f895a789392ce8a09d13<br/>

flag: bcb04466bee8f895a789392ce8a09d13
