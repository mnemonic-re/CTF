**Writeup**

This is a very simple challenge. While you can (and should) try to write a script to solve this, I suggest using some decryption service.

This is a subistitution cypher so making a script is easy. I might add it. Anyway, go to the website and copy all of the "TEXT".

Go for example to https://quipqiup.com/ and feed it the data.

You get following:

THE FLAG IS IFONLYMODERNCRYPTOWASLIKETHIS. GENERATED BY MARKOV CHAIN OF THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE......

Now that you know what subistition it is, script is even more easier but...

flag: IFONLYMODERNCRYPTOWASLIKETHIS
