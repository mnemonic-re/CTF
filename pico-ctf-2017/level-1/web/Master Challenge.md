Very easy. If you look at the source code and then go to the javascript file you can see some code.

And at the top we have:

> //Validate the password. TBD!<br/>
> function validate(pword){<br/>
>   //TODO: Implement me<br/>
>   return false;<br/>
> }<br/>

We can interact with the site using the developer console (F12). Then we just create our own validation and set it to true:

> validate = function(hax) { return true; }<br/>
> Æ’ (hax) { return true; }<br/>

Now type anything in the password field and you get the flag.
