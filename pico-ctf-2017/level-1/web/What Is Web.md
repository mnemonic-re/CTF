**Writeup**

This is the only WEB challenge in level1 and it is super easy.

Visit the page and of course - CAT. But ignore the cat and "View Page Source". There you can see some files\links and some comments in each file.

So basically this flag is split into three pieces. We already see the first one in comments so write it down. 

All the flags are in the commentd block.

First part of the flag is on "View Page Source", second part is in "hacker.css" and final part is in "script.js"

flag: 9daca0510ff + eb6c5680635 + f1ef52d049f = 9daca0510ffeb6c5680635f1ef52d049f
