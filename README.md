CTF Writeups

This is a repository of my experiences with CTF competitions. There have been a lot over the years but every writeup was left on my HDD or
ended up on some blog or forums.

Now I will slowly but surely fill up my repos :) I will try to go into much details as possible but sometimes it isnt easy to put a big
challenge into words. But hey.

That is why this is for beginners where challenges are simple enough that few screenshots and scripts with decent explanation can do wonders
